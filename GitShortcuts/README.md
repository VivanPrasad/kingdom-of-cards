# kingdom-of-cards/GitShortcuts
Made by [TJ](https://www.github.com/TJ20201/). These are shortcuts to assist multi-line Git commands, such as rollbacking to origin and pulling (useful for when `project.godot` changes without you wanting it to) and more.

## Force Pull
This is a specialised version of `git pull` that resets to the latest commit and THEN pulls. This means you don't have to commit, reset and then pull which is usually a 3-line command resulting in an additional commit that gets removed anyways.
